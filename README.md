# Paint by Numbers (CSC Hacks)

A paint by numbers video game created in Java.

## Project Description
* Our end goal is a fully functional paint by numbers game that allows the user to import their own photos.
* This project will fill a gap in the paint by numbers game market: no games allow users to select their own photos.
* We will have to learn in-depth about image manipulation in Java, as well as image manipulation algorithms, to accomplish this. 
* We anticipate the most difficult part of the project being reducing colors in an image to stylize it as a paint by numbers.
