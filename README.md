# Paint by Numbers (CSC Hacks)

A paint by numbers video game created in Java.

## MVP Demo

To try out this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your machine. You will need to install Java to run this program.

---
### To run the precompiled program:
Open command prompt, navigate to the 'bin' folder, and run 'java Launcher'

    >cd Desktop\paint-by-numbers\bin
    >java Launcher

### If you would prefer to compile the program yourself:
Open command prompt, navigate to the 'src' folder, and run 'javac Launcher.java', followed by 'java Launcher'

    >cd Desktop\paint-by-numbers\src
    >javac Launcher.java
    >java Launcher

---
### Controls
* Use the 'Select Image' button to pick an image to paint. You can use any of the example images from the bin folder or one of your own. It must be a .png file.
* A mouse is necessary to use this program
* Left click or left click and drag to paint the image
* Hold right click and drag to pan around the image
* Use the scroll wheel to zoom in/out
* Use the 'Reveal Image' button to show the fully painted image

## Project Description
* Our end goal is a fully functional paint by numbers game that allows the user to import their own photos.
* This project will fill a gap in the paint by numbers game market: no games allow users to select their own photos.
* We will have to learn in-depth about image manipulation in Java, as well as image manipulation algorithms, to accomplish this. 
* We anticipate the most difficult part of the project being reducing colors in an image to stylize it as a paint by numbers.
